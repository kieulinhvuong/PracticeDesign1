# Design Exercise #1


Twitter is a platform on which users can post comments and content. In order to receive another user's posts, a user must tell the system that they want to follow that other user. Whenever a user posts a ``tweet'', it is sent to all of their followers. Central to all of this is managing the followers. You have been asked to implement a new follower management system. In your system, a user must be able to add or remove themselves as a follower of another user. (Add has no effect if they are already following the other user and remove has no effect if they are not.) It must also be able to identify the followers of a user in order to send them any tweets that the user posts.
